Style change detection in texts is an important topic in literary studies and natural language processing applications. In this paper, we wish to solve a classic problem of author identification in the works of William Shakespeare, which are known to have been written in collaboration with John Fletcher, by detecting stylistic changes. We will tackle the problem using supervised machine learning techniques and analyze several sets of stylistic features to determine which ones are most suitable in this context.
